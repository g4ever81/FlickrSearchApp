# Flickr Search App - iOS Code Challenge

This is an iOS app built using **SwiftUI** that allows users to search for images on Flickr and view details about each image. The app fetches data from the [Flickr Public Feed API](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) and displays the results in a grid. Tapping on an image opens a detail view with additional information.

- **Progress Indicator**: Displays a loading spinner while fetching images.
- **Unit Tests**: Includes unit tests for the data model and network layer.
- **UI Tests**: Includes UI tests to verify the app's functionality.
